/**
 * Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test
 *
 * Based on the idea of testing for the presence of a unit root
 * in an autoagressive time series sample.
 *
 * The role of the ADF hypothesis test is to consider the null hypothesis that
 * gamma = 0, which would indicte that the process is a random walk and thus
 * non mean reverting
 *
 * If the hyppothesis that gamma = 0 can be rejected then the following movement
 * of the price series is propotional to the current price and thus it is unlikely
 * to be a random walk.
